To solve the `@apply` issue, ensure that `text-my-custom-class` is defined in your Tailwind configuration or in your CSS. To address purging, update your `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './bug.html'], // Add paths to your HTML files
  theme: {
    extend: {
      textColor: {
        'my-custom-class': '#3b82f6',
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
This ensures that your `text-my-custom-class` is included. If using JIT mode (recommended), this issue is mitigated. For `bug.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Tailwind Bug</title>
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div class="@apply text-my-custom-class"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
The corrected `bugSolution.html` will have the CSS class correctly defined and added to `tailwind.config.js` to fix the purging problem.
